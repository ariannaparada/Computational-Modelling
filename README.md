Tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) spreads in a stereotypical pattern that is hypothesized to follow the brain’s structural connectivity. This project explores how well connectomes from
different cognitive stages can predict the regional spread of tau,
using network diffusion and production-spread models. Structural
connectomes from the ADNI dataset were analyzed across four cognitive groups: 
cognitively normal (CN), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and dementia (DEM). 
We applied an analysis to assess connectivity changes
across groups and implemented three network spreading models: 
the Network Diffusion Model (NDM), the Fisher-Kolmogorov-
Petrovsky-Piscounov (FKPP) model, and the weighted FKPP model
incorporating regional amyloid-beta. Results showed that the FKPP
and weighted FKPP models consistently outperformed the NDM in
predicting tau PET data. Incorporating amyloid-beta improved predictions further, 
particularly in the entorhinal and medial temporal
regions. These findings support the hypothesis that tau spread in
AD is both connectivity and amyloid-driven, with potential implications for personalized disease modelling.
